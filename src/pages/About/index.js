                Iâ€™m Harry Lai, a programmer from Hong Kong who graduated from Coventry University with writing & design software experience for 5+ years. I have been involved in various stages of the system, including system design, development, testing, and deployment. <br/><br/>

                Proficient in System Design, Coding and System Testing. <br/><br/>

                I absolutely love indulging in a hot cup of coffee, binge-watching my favourite movies and TV shows, playing thrilling video games, and engaging in anything related to music. Bruno Mars is, without a doubt, my all-time favourite singer. <br/>
